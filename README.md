# OCPP CSMS (OCPP 2.0.1.)

Charging station Management system for electric vehicle charging stations.

Based on: OCPP-2.0.1 (Full protocol documentation:
[openchargealliance.org/downloads](https://www.openchargealliance.org/downloads/))

**_ Under development _**

## Working principle

E.g. incoming BootNotificationRequest:

charging station -> websocket-service -> GCP Pub/Sub topic "BootNotificationRequest" -> device-service

charging station <- websocket-service <- GCP Pub/Sub topic "BootNotificationResponse" <- device-service

## Functional features:

- Implemented OCPP messages:

| Implemented OCPP Messages                             | Microservice name   |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| BootNotificationRequest, BootNotificationResponse     | device-service      |
| HeartbeatRequest, HeartbeatResponse                   | device-service      |
| StatusNotificationRequest, StatusNotificationResponse | device-service      |
| TransactionEventRequest, TransactionEventResponse     | transaction-service |
| AuthorizeRequest, AuthorizeResponse                   | user-service        |

## Technical features:

- microservice-based architecture
- GO: managing multiple websocket connections easily with goroutines, multithreading would be more tedious in many other languages 
- Google Firestore for simple data persistence
- Google Cloud Pub/Sub for async messaging between services (using [watermill.io](https://github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/watermill))
- REST API for managing charging station information (API description: [swaggerhub.com](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/gregszalay/ocpp_device_service/v2.0.0))

## Quick Start

1. Create a **Google Cloud Platform project**. Follow the [google guide](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects).

2. Create a **service account** and create **JSON credentials** for it. Follow the [google guide](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials) (see the _"Service account credentials"_ section). When you create the service account, under "select a role" choose `Pub/Sub Admin`、`Firebase Admin`、`Cloud Datastore Owner`、`Firestore Service Agent` and `Firebase Rules Firestore Service Agent` (note: for production use, you may want to restrict these to lower roles, needs to be tested).

P
3. Enable `Cloud Pub/Sub API`、`Cloud Firestore API` and `Cloud Datastore API`.
   - Set from APIs & Services -> Enabled APIs & services -> +ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES

4. Enable `Datastore`  from https://console.cloud.google.com/datastore/welcome?project={YOUR_PROJECT_ID}
   - When you create data, can here see the data.

5.Once you have the JSON credentials, place them in the following directories, under the name 'PRIVATE.json':
   - credentials/PRIVATE.json

> Note: you can use the same service account and the same JSON credentials file in all places, or you can create separate ones for extra security if you want

4. Create a Cloud Firestore database Follow the [google guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart)

5. In the **docker-compose.yml** file, replace `chargerevolutioncloud` name with the **project id** of your own GCP project.

6. Install docker and docker-compose if you haven't already

7. If you are deploying on a remote machine or VPS, **open** up port `3000` and port `5000` so you can access the system from your own machine.

> Important: For actual deployment you should add a reverse proxy layer or some other security measure to protect your open port. A good place to start: [How To Deploy a Go Web Application with Docker and Nginx on Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-deploy-a-go-web-application-with-docker-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-18-04)

7.  Build and run the docker images with

        docker compose up --build

    or

        docker compose up --build -d

    to hide console output

8.  The device service should now be running on `localhost:5000`. Use Postman or some other tool to send a post request and create a charging station (API description: [swaggerhub.com](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/gregszalay/ocpp_device_service/v2.0.0)) For example, you can send something like this in the request payload:

    POST: `localhost:5000/chargingstations/create`

        {
            "id": "CS123",
            "serialNumber": "5",
            "model": "CS-5500",
            "vendorName": "ChargerMaker Inc.",
            "firmwareVersion": "1.8",
            "modem": {
                "iccid": "24",
                "imsi": "24"
            },
            "location": {
                "lat": 41.366446,
                "lng": -38.1854651
            }
        }

    If this is successful, a collection named _"chargingstations"_ and a document named _"CS123"_ should have been created in the Firestore database of your project.

9.  The websocket service should be running on `localhost:3000`. Connect to port 3000 as a websocket client (use the station id you have created in the previous step):

    `ws://{HOST}:3000/ocpp/{stationid}`

    > Tip: Postman now supports websocket connections (beta version), but only on the Windows desktop app I believe. This could be useful for testing. Or you can have a look at my basic charging station simulator: [gregszalay/ocpp-charging-station-simulator](https://github.com/gregszalay/ocpp-charging-station-simulator)

### To-do

- secure websocket connections (wss)
- full implementation of all basic messages (reset, getconfig etc.)
